# Currency-Converter
An Android app provides a convenient way to convert between foreign currencies and a user’s home currency.

Currency exchange rates are always fluctuating and may even change from one minute to the next, so it’s important that the user have access to the most up-to- date data. The Currencies app fetches the latest exchange rates from a web service hosted by openexchangerates.org.
